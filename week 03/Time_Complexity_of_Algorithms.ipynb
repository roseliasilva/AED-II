This is not surprising since there is more data to process. However, this tells us more. It gives us an insight on the rate at which it is increasing. The red line is a straight line, which means that the time is growing somewhat proportionally with the data.\n","\n","This is good news because it means that the execution time grows at the same rate as the data. Doubling the amount of data will double the amount of time needed to process it.\n","\n","The purpose of this lesson is to learn how to look at an algorithm and derive a mathematical expression for the red line. As mentioned before, we call such an expression the **time complexity of the algorithm**:\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dN9rz7VL_lTmwtQT7bQX6fjl6KibPTTR\" width=\"30%\">\n","</center>\n","\n","With the time complexity model, we are able to plug in a list length and get an idea of the execution time of the algorithm for that input length without needing to actually run the code. In general, the time complexity can have several behaviors; it does not always grow as a straight line. We will learn several types of growth throughout this course. By the end of this course, you'll be able to analyze an algorithm and provide a time complexity model:\n","\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zvgWSpfiPXh98wNCPrHhNPQvttQ9auGk\" width=\"30%\">\n","</center>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F8-LjZq4yH9H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Modeling Execution Times"],"metadata":{"id":"K5u-WvhwyYcm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["On this section, we'll learn how we can analyze the time complexity of the following function that computes the sum of all values in a given list:\n","\n","```python\n","def sum_values(values):\n","    total = 0            \n","    for value in values:\n","        total += value   \n","    return total\n","```\n","\n","Recall that we don't want to know the exact execution time, just how fast it is growing.

Worst-Case Analysis"],"metadata":{"id":"jeGbP47l3bOQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Great success! Our experiments match our theoretical model! When you plotted the execution times on the previous screen, if everything went well, you got something similar to what we did with the **maximum()** function:\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1H2Gjki2Aexk1Jo2wAT8rkncqji1H0p2j\" width=\"30%\">\n","</center>\n","\n","\n","We added the red line to highlight the tendency for the execution to grow linearly (as a straight line).\n","\n","In our analysis on the previous screen, we needed to count how many times each line of code was executed. However, we cannot always do that. Consider for instance the **maximum()** function from before:\n","\n","```python\n","def maximum(values):\n","    answer = None\n","    for value in values:\n","        if answer == None or answer < value:\n","            answer = value\n","    return answer\n","```\n","\n","How many times is the line **answer = value** executed? Well, that depends on the **values** list. The first time, it is always executed because **answer** is initially set to **None**. After that, it depends on the order of the elements in **values**.\n","\n","For example, if **values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]** then, at every subsequent iteration, **answer < value** will be true, so the line will be executed one time for each value. On the other hand, if **values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]** then, the first time **answer** will be set to **5**, and then the line will never be executed again.\n","\n","We say that the first is a **worst-case** execution analysis and the latter a **best-case** execution analysis. When building a model for the execution time of an algorithm, we often focus on the worst case. There a few reasons for doing so:\n","\n","- We usually want to process data from a lot of different sources and, consequently, it turns out that the worst-case actually occurs quite often.\n","- It provides an upper bound. By focusing on the worst-case when building the execution time model, we can guarantee that the executions times will always behave at most as badly as the models predicts. Imagine that you are selling an algorithm that 1% of the time takes one second, and 99% takes over one year. If you advertise it as taking one second (best case), your customers will not be very pleased.\n","\n","In practice, this means that when building the model, the number of executions that we set for each line of code is the maximum number of times that it can possibly be executed.\n","\n","With this in mind, let's build a model for the **maximum()** function and see whether it matches our experimental prediction.\n","\n","```python\n","def maximum(values):\n","    answer = None                            # c1, 1 time,  c1\n","    for value in values:                     # c2, N times, c2*N\n","        if answer == None or answer < value: # c3, N times, c3*N\n","            answer = value                   # c4, N times, c4*N\n","    return answer                            # c5, 1 time,  c5\n","```\n","\n","Adding the values together and grouping the terms we get:\n","\n","$\n","c_1 + c_2 \\times N + c_3 \\times N + c_4 \\times N + c_5 = (c_2 + c_3 + c_4) \\times N + (c_1 + c_5)\n","$\n","\n","Cleaning up the constants by renaming $c_2 + c_3 + c_4$ as $α$ and $c_1 + c_5$ as $β$, we again obtain a linear model $αN + β$, as expected.
